        <br />

          <p class="left">
            In our world we barely know anything about magic, yet it surrounds
            us in every step we take, we inhale the power of unknown with every
            breath. We don`t see the air, yet we cannot exist without it. That`s
            how magic works. On this page I will introduce you the basics of
            ancient techniques that can help you to heal, to change your life
            and utilize the power of magic in your everyday activities.
          </p>
          <p class="mid">
            Why to use magic? Our world is evolving. We bring newer and newer
            things in technology every day, newly invented (and re-invented)
            products, services come on our way wherever we look. Magic is old
            and often forgotten, yet it can beat any technological invention,
            any magic pill, or essence.
          </p>
          <p class="right">
            Magic doesn`t necesseraly come in the shape of firy balls flying
            around, or flaming breath of a dragon. There`s no need for sticks
            and magical balls glowing in the dark, however, if you feel better-
            then use them! <br />
            It`s more important what you believe and how strongly you believe
            than what brand of magician cape you`re wearing.

        <h2>How to do magic?</h2>
        <br />
        <div class="text">
          <p class="left">
            Magic is within us. Whether we decide using it or not, it`s in us.
            All you need to do is BELIEVE, and the magic will come. On this page
            you`ll find forgotten secret spells and formulas. They are simple,
            you may already have heard about them, even used them without being
            aware of their true power.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="right">
            Dreaming about something is kind of a good start but don`t forget:
            dreams without goals just dreams! <br />
            To ensure you get where you want to be you need to know exactly
            where it is. How that place looks like. Whow it feels being there,
            how it smells- everything needs to be pixel perfect in your
            visualization- that`s where the magic starts.
